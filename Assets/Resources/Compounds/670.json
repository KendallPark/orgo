Its addition to blood preservation solutions results in better maintenance of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate levels during storage. It is readily phosphorylated to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by triokinase in erythrocytes. In combination with naphthoquinones it acts as a sunscreening agent.","DescriptionSourceName":"MeSH","DescriptionURL":"//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68004098"},"structure":{"atoms":{"1":{"aid":1,"element":"o","x":-2.4087,"y":0.0956,"z":-0.0031},"2":{"aid":2,"element":"o","x":2.4087,"y":0.0955,"z":0.0027},"3":{"aid":3,"element":"o","x":0,"y":1.2771,"z":0.0003},"4":{"aid":4,"element":"c","x":0,"y":0.047,"z":-0.0002},"5":{"aid":5,"element":"c","x":-1.2837,"y":-0.7576,"z":0.0057},"6":{"aid":6,"element":"c","x":1.2837,"y":-0.7575,"z":-0.0053},"7":{"aid":7,"element":"h","x":-1.3178,"y":-1.3664,"z":0.9131},"8":{"aid":8,"element":"h","x":-1.3182,"y":-1.4051,"z":-0.8749},"9":{"aid":9,"element":"h","x":1.3178,"y":-1.3671,"z":-0.9121},"10":{"aid":10,"element":"h","x":1.3182,"y":-1.404,"z":0.8759},"11":{"aid":11,"element":"h","x":-2.4082,"y":0.5715,"z":-0.8512},"12":{"aid":12,"element":"h","x":2.4082,"y":0.5723,"z":0.8503}},"bonds":{"1":{"bid":1,"vertices":[1,5],"order":"single"},"2":{"bid":2,"vertices":[1,11],"order":"single"},"3":{"bid":3,"vertices":[2,6],"order":"single"},"4":{"bid":4,"vertices":[2,12],"order":"single"},"5":{"bid":5,"vertices":[3,4],"order":"double"},"6":{"bid":6,"vertices":[4,5],"order":"single"},"7":{"bid":7,"vertices":[4,6],"order":"single"},"8":{"bid":8,"vertices":[5,7],"order":"single"},"9":{"bid":9,"vertices":[5,8],"order":"single"},"10":{"bid":10,"vertices":[6,9],"order":"single"},"11":{"bid":11,"vertices":[6,10],"order":"single"}}}}
